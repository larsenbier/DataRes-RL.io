# DataRes-RL.io

## Game Ideas:
* Slither.io:
  * advantages:
    * only three inputs: left, right, boost
    * Can use images of game for training, no explicit gamestates needed.
    * Stanford CS Slither.io [Example](https://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2019aut/data/assignment_308832_raw/26588099.pdf)
    * RL [environment](https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html)
* Connect4:

## Training Ideas:
* [Deep Q Learning](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/en/unit3/deep-q-algorithm) (read [Q-Learning](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/en/unit2/q-learning) first)
* Feed in screenshots of the game to choose the policy, learn policy values using temporally spaced screenshots of the game screen (see the Hugging Face deep Q learning example).
